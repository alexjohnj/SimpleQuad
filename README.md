SimpleQuad
==========

Thanks for downloading SimpleQuad. SimpleQuad is a really basic application that is capable of solving quadratic equations using the quadratic formula. This is its single purpose. The application has received limited testing but over time, the method I've used to calculate the answers to questions has been refined and so the application _should_ have become more reliable and accurate over time. 

Stuff That Needs Doing
--------------------------

There's a few things that need doing for SimpleQuad. Here they are:

- Translation into as many frickin' languages as possible. 
- More testing. To make sure this thing is really accurate. 
- Perhaps some way to simply type the quadratic equation rather than entering just the coefficients of the equation.

Not too much to get done. All contributions are greatly appreciated (**especially** translations, wink, wink). 

Thanks.
