# SimpleQuad 1.2 #
## August 1st, 2011 ##

- The user interface has been simplified. You no longer need to enter positive and negative versions of bx. SimpleQuad now automatically converts between these states for you.
- Positive and negative versions are now worked out simultaneously rather than individually. 
- New icon! It's still not great (I'm no graphics designer) but I think it's a massive improvement over the old one.
- AutoCalc has been added. Answers are now automatically calculated as you type (this can be disabled within the preferences window). 
- Tidied up the menubar. 
- Added a new preferences window.
- Added the ability to customise the frequency updates are checked for and if new updates are automatically installed. 
- Added the option to quit SimpleQuad when the last window is closed (enabled by default).
- X's are now represented using the mathematical x (ùë•) rather than the letter x (Lion only).
